# Task: 0

## 🧠 Purpose of the Code
This program scans input text and identifies specific tokens: **"I", "Eat", "Rice"**, classifying them as **Noun**, **Verb**, and **Object** respectively. It ignores whitespace and flags anything else as an unknown token.

---

## 🔍 Code Breakdown

### 1. **Header and Options**
```c
%option noyywrap
%{
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
%}
```
- `%option noyywrap`: Prevents Flex from expecting a `yywrap()` function after input ends.
- `%{ ... %}`: C code block included in the generated scanner—standard headers for I/O and memory.

---

### 2. **Rules Section**
```c
%%

[Ii]      {printf("Token = %s -> Noun\n", yytext);}
[Ee]at    {printf("Token = %s -> Verb\n", yytext);}
[Rr]ice   {printf("Token = %s -> Object\n", yytext);}
[ \t\n] ; // Ignore whitespace
.         { printf("Unknown Token: %s\n", yytext); }

%%
```

Each rule follows the format:  
**Pattern → Action**

- `[Ii]`: Matches "I" or "i" → prints as **Noun**
- `[Ee]at`: Matches "Eat" or "eat" → prints as **Verb**
- `[Rr]ice`: Matches "Rice" or "rice" → prints as **Object**
- `[ \t\n]`: Matches space, tab, newline → **ignored**
- `.`: Matches any single character not caught by earlier rules → flagged as **Unknown**

> 💡 `yytext` is a special variable holding the matched string.

---

### 3. **Main Function**
```c
int main(void) {
    printf("=== Lexical Analysis ===\n");
    yylex(); // Start scanning input
    printf("=== Tokenization Completed ===\n");
    return 0;
}
```
- `yylex()` is the scanner function generated by Flex.
- It reads from standard input and applies the rules above.

---

## 🧪 Sample Input & Output

**Input:**
```
I eat rice
```

**Output:**
```
=== Lexical Analysis ===
Token = I -> Noun
Token = eat -> Verb
Token = rice -> Object
=== Tokenization Completed ===
```

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

Assuming you’ve saved this as `prog0.i`:

```bash
flex prog0.i
gcc lex.yy.c -o lexer
./lexer
```

Then type your input and press Enter.

If you’d like, I can help you extend this to handle more tokens, or even build a parser next. Want to add adjectives or punctuation handling?


## ✅ What `%option noyywrap` Does

When you add:
```c
%option noyywrap
```

You’re telling Flex:  
> “Don’t expect or require a `yywrap()` function. Just stop scanning when input ends.”

This simplifies your code and avoids linker errors like:
```
undefined reference to `yywrap`
```

---

## 🧪 Without `%option noyywrap`

If you omit it, you’d need to define:
```c
int yywrap(void) {
    return 1;
}
```

Just to satisfy Flex—even though it’s not doing anything useful in your case.

## 🧠 Summary

| Feature         | With `%option noyywrap` | Without it |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------|
| `yywrap()` required? | ❌ No                  | ✅ Yes      |
| Input continues after EOF? | ❌ Stops immediately | ✅ Can continue if `yywrap()` returns 0 |
| Simpler for single input? | ✅ Yes              | ❌ No       |
